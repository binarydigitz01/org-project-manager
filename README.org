* Introduction
This plugin was created by me to tackle an issue: Having 1 org roam node per project, and to navigate to it very quickly.
This plugin uses [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][projectile]] to recognize a project.[[https://github.com/IvanMalison/org-projectile][ Org-projectile]] is similar, but it does not have org roam integration.

* Usage
** Main usage
The main entry point for this plugin is: org-project-manager-open-node.
If this is used for the first time in a project, it asks for an org-roam-node. It will remember that node in the future sessions.

You can use org-project-manager-delete to reset known nodes for projects.

NOTE: The node should be pre existing. First use org-roam-node-find if a node for the project does not exist.

This plugin is still in production stage, so if you find any issues please do report them.

** Capturing information
To quickly capture information to the current project org roam node, you can use org-project-manager-capture-current.
It uses org-roam-capture in the backend, so all org-roam-capture-templates are respected.

* Project.el support
If you use project.el instead of projectile, you can set org-project-manager-default-project to 'project.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-project-manager-default-project 'project)
#+end_src
